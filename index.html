     <h2>Some deap news inside the team</h2>
     <h3>Luton Town 1-1 Liverpool: Luis Diaz ends emotional week with late Liverpool equaliser</h3>
     <p>
Luis Diaz last played for Liverpool in the Premier League on 21 October<br>
Luis Diaz came off the bench to salvage a point for Liverpool with a stoppage-time goal at Luton in his first match since
his parents were kidnapped in Colombia.<br>
Diaz's father remains missing, and the forward lifted his shirt to show a message of "freedom for papa" after heading in Harvey Elliott's cross five minutes into added time.
He later issued a statement calling for those holding his father to release him "immediately".<br>
The 26-year-old former Porto player had last featured in a Liverpool squad 10 days ago, but manager Jurgen Klopp said 
before this match that Diaz "wanted to be part of the team".<br>
His goal was a poignant and remarkable conclusion to a contest in which Luton had appeared on course for a deserved first <br>
league win of the season at Kenilworth Road and a first victory over the Reds since 1991.

     <h3>Newcastle 1-0 Arsenal: Mikel Arteta must face scruting for trying to fix something not broken</h3>

     <p>
       <strong> Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta will pick through the wreckage of what he perceived - to put it very mildly <br>
        - as a gross injustice on Tyneside, before turning attention to the shortcomings of his own team.</strong><br>

        When he does, however, an emotional and visibly angry Arteta must face inevitable scrutiny about whether he has also reduced Arsenal's
        effectiveness and fluency by applying a fix to something that was not broken.

        <i>All discussion about Arsenal's first Premier League defeat of the season at Newcastle United must start and will be shaped by events<br> 
        in and around the 64th-minute goal by Anthony Gordon that led to their downfall.</i>

        Arteta went through the card to outline his displeasure at a truly bizarre sequence that saw Gordon's goal checked for whether the ball<br> 
        had gone out of play, a potential foul by Joelinton on Gabriel and offside against the scorer before this version of a video assistant referee multiple choice finally let Newcastle celebrate - and Arsenal fume.


        <!--The blockquote which is showing by BBC Journal quoting Arteta words-->
<blockquote>"Embarrassing what happened, How this goal stands in the Premier League - this league we say is the best in the world. 
    I've been 20 years in this country and now I feel ashamed. It's a disgrace. There's too much at stake here."</blockquote> Said Arteta
